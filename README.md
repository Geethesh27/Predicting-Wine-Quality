# Predicting-Wine-Quality
I have taken data from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality and made this project
In this project I used two datasets red wine and white wine
Variables are Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):
   1 - fixed acidity
   2 - volatile acidity
   3 - citric acid
   4 - residual sugar
   5 - chlorides
   6 - free sulfur dioxide
   7 - total sulfur dioxide
   8 - density
   9 - pH
   10 - sulphates
   11 - alcohol
Output variable (based on sensory data): 
   12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)
   In red wine predction Accuracy is 83%
   In white wine predction Accuracy is 80%
